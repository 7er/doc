## What is NAIS?

NAIS is an open source application platform that aims to provide our developers with the best possible tools needed to
develop and run their applications.

## Getting started with NAIS

If you are just starting out developing applications and wish to deploy them to NAIS, it is highly recommended to read
through the [Getting started](basics/README.md) section!

## Why NAIS exists

When you have a large development organisation, providing the developers with turnkey solutions for their most common
needs can be a good investment.

This includes \(but not limited to\) [logging](observability/logs/README.md), [metrics](observability/metrics.md),
[alerts](observability/alerts/README.md), [deployment](basics/deploy.md) and a [runtime environment](basics/clusters.md).

Within each of these aspects, we leverage open source projects best suited for our needs and provide them with usable
abstractions, sane defaults and the required security hardening.

### GitOps

GitOps is a way of implementing Continuous Deployment for cloud native applications. It focuses on a developer-centric
experience when operating infrastructure, by using tools developers are already familiar with, including Git and
Continuous Deployment tools.
