# What is NAIS?

NAIS is an open source application platform that aims to provide our developers with the best possible tools needed to develop and run their applications.

# Why NAIS exists

When you have a large development organization, providing the developers with turnkey solutions for their most common needs can be a good investment.

This includes (but not limited to) [logging](../logging), [metrics](../metrics), [alerts](../alerts), [deployment](../deploy) and a [runtime environment](../clusters).

Within each of these aspects, we leverage open source projects best suited for our needs and provide them with usable abstractions, sane defaults and the required security hardening.
