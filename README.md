# Introduction

## What is NAIS?

NAIS is an open source application platform that aims to provide our developers with the best possible tools needed to develop and run their applications.

## Why NAIS exists

When you have a large development organisation, providing the developers with turnkey solutions for their most common needs can be a good investment.

This includes \(but not limited to\) [logging](https://github.com/nais/doc/tree/ed810945684e0f22aaeec0662a28da7a397f6b67/logging/README.md), [metrics](https://github.com/nais/doc/tree/ed810945684e0f22aaeec0662a28da7a397f6b67/metrics/README.md), [alerts](https://github.com/nais/doc/tree/ed810945684e0f22aaeec0662a28da7a397f6b67/alerts/README.md), [deployment](https://github.com/nais/doc/tree/ed810945684e0f22aaeec0662a28da7a397f6b67/deploy/README.md) and a [runtime environment](https://github.com/nais/doc/tree/ed810945684e0f22aaeec0662a28da7a397f6b67/clusters/README.md).

Within each of these aspects, we leverage open source projects best suited for our needs and provide them with usable abstractions, sane defaults and the required security hardening.
