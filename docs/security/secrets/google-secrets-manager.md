# Google Secrets Manager

You may store secrets in [Google Secrets Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager) as an alternative to the other offered solutions. Note that this is currently only offered as a secure storage of your secrets for your team.

## Status

Currently, NAIS applications cannot read these secrets. An integration that allows one-way synchronization of secrets in Secrets Manager to [Kubernetes Secrets](kubernetes-secrets.md) in GCP is planned by the end of 2020.

## Getting started

Start at the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/security/secret-manager) page and refer to the [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs) for guides and how-tos on creating and managing secrets.
