# naisdevice

{% hint style="info" title="TL;DR" %}
naisdevice is currently in open beta. When released it will replace NAVTunnel/ScaleFT.
{% endhint %}

naisdevice is the mechanism used by NAV employees to connect to internal services.
It is based on [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com) for connectivity and [Kolide](https://www.kolide.com/) for ensuring that the device is in a healthy state. 

If you want to understand more about how it works, head over to the [github repository](https://github.com/nais/device) and check out the project documentation.
