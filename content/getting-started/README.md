Getting started
===============

## Install required tools
In order to interact with the clusters, you're going to need a kubectl binary.   
To interact with clusters in Google cloud, you're going to need the Google cloud SDK in addition.   
Google's cloud SDK ships with kubectl, so this is the only package you need to install.  
[Download](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/downloads-versioned-archives) the relevant package for your operating system and follow the instructions to get started.   
Make sure you answer yes when prompted to let the installer modify your profile to update your PATH in order to get gclouds binary directory added to your path.

### Install useful tools
There are several tools that help visualize and simplify kubernetes configuration.
Although not required, they come highly recommended.  
[kubectx](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx) - Simplifies changing cluster and namespace context.   
[kubeaware](https://github.com/jhrv/kubeaware) - visualize which cluster and namespace is currently active.

## Accessing the clusters
Clone the [kubeconfig](https://github.com/navikt/kubeconfigs.git) (_private_) repository to get a kubeconfig file with the necessary configuration for our internal clusters   
To use this kubeconfig as your default, either symlink the `config` file (or copy if you're on windows) to `~/.kube`, or point the environment variable `KUBECONFIG` to the `config` file.   

### First time use
The first time you're attempting to communicate with either cluster, you are required to authenticate with Azure AD.
1. Before you can begin using `Kubectl`, you need to authorise with Azure.
1. Switch to a cluster `kubectl config use-context preprod-fss` (or `kubectl preprod-fss`if you've installed kubectl)
1. Run `kubectl get pods` and you will then be asked to authorise with Azure. Go to the address, use the code, and log in with your NAV e-post and NAV-ident password. When your user has been authorised, the shell-command will finish and return a list of pods running in the cluster.

> This guide contains several steps and links specific to developers at NAV. Some of them link to internal information in private repositories. 

## Install the necessary tools

We recommend Linux-VDI users to use [utvikler-ansible](https://github.com/navikt/utvikler-ansible) to set up their images.

For Linux- and Windows-VDI, you need to set up [NAV-proxy](/content/getting-started/README.md#system-environment-variables) before installing the tools.


### Install Kubectl

> Use the Kubernetes command-line tool, kubectl, to deploy and manage applications on Kubernetes. Using kubectl, you can inspect cluster resources; create, delete, and update components; and look at your new cluster and bring up example apps.

Linux and Mac users can use the install guide over at [Kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) to install Kubectl. Windows users can follow the guide below. All three types of users need to [configure Kubectl](/content/getting-started/README.md#configure-kubectl) after installation.

What you can and can't do in the clusters are governed by RBAC-rules that are defined in the [Naisible-repo](https://github.com/nais/naisible/blob/master/files/roles/clusterroles.yaml). This is a bit technical, and it's better to read up on [Kubectl operations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/#operations) over at Kubernetes.io. We also have made a small set of [Kubectl operation examples](/content/getting-started/kubectl_examples.md).


#### Install Kubectl on Windows

1. Download Kubectl from `F:\programvare\kubectl\kubectl.exe`. Put the file where you usually install files
2. Add `kubectl.exe` to the system environment variable `$PATH`
3. Check if everything is working by restarting your shell and running `kubectl`


#### Configure Kubectl

1. Clone [kubeconfigs](https://github.com/navikt/kubeconfigs) from Github
2. Point the `KUBECONFIG` environment-variable to the `config` file in the cloned repo*
3. Before you can begin using `Kubectl`, you need to authorise with Azure.
 a. Switch to a cluster `kubectl config use-context preprod-fss`
 b. Run `kubectl get pods` and you will then be asked to authorise with Azure. Go to the address, use the code, and log in with your NAV e-post and NAV-ident password. When your user has been authorised, the shell-command will finish and return a list of pods running in the cluster.


##### Changing passwords

Every time you change your NAV-ident password, you need to reset your Kubeconfigs credentials.

You will get an error similar to the one below:

```text
Failed to acquire a token: refreshing the expired token: refreshing token: adal: Refresh request failed. Status Code = '400'. Response body: {"error":"invalid_grant","error_description":"AADSTS50173: The provided grant has expired due to it being revoked. The user might have changed or reset their password. ...
```

The easiest way to fix this is to run the following commands in the `kubeconfigs`-repo:
```bash
git checkout -- .
git reset
git pull
```

Alternatively you can just remove the values under `user.auth-provider.config` for the following keys, in the `kubeconfigs/config`-yaml file: `access-token`, `refresh-token`, `expires-in`, `expires-on`.

After that, follow the instruction to [configure kubectl](/content/getting-started/README.md#configure-kubectl).

PS: Some users have had to change Kubernetes context/cluster for the change to take effect.


### Install Docker

> Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications, whether on laptops, data center VMs, or the cloud.

Follow the [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)-guide for local testing and development.


#### Install Docker on Windows VDI

Since we are running our Windows VDI with virtualisation off, we need to have the Docker daemon running on an external Linux-server or VDI.

1. Install Docker CE by following the guide at [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/docker-windows)
   * You need to disable `hyper-v`
   * You need to reboot you machine
2. Set system environment variable `DOCKER_HOST` to point to a Linux server running a Docker daemon
   * `DOCKER_HOST=tcp://enlinuxserversomhardockerinstallert:port`


## System environment variables

You need the following variables set in your VDI:

```text
http_proxy=http://webproxy-utvikler.nav.no:8088
https_proxy=http://webproxy-utvikler.nav.no:8088
no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1,*.adeo.no,.local,.adeo.no,.nav.no,.aetat.no,.devillo.no,.oera.no,devel
```
