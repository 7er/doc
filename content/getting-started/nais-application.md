# Getting started with a NAIS application

Create a manifest file for any application you want to deploy. Store it as `nais.yaml` in a repository on Github.

A nais.yaml file contains an Application resource. The application resource provides NAIS with the necessary information to run your application. If starting out for the first time, try the [nais.yaml minimal example](https://github.com/nais/doc/tree/8c67c55b42d6da64d90f83effa058ac58e70d79c/content/deploy/examples/nais-manifest/nais.yaml). The entire specification for the NAIS manifest you can find [here](../deploy/nais-manifest.md).

Build Docker image and push to Docker repository.
