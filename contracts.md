## Logging

Configure your application to log to console (stdout/stderr), it will be scraped and sent to elasticsearch and made available via [Kibana](https://logs.adeo.no)
If you want more information than just the log message (logleve, MDC, etc), you should log in JSON format; the fields you provide will then be indexed.
